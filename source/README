# Light Controls

A python program to use a Pikatea GB3 macropad to control Wi-Fi Lightbulbs.

A Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W receives keyboard inputs from the macropad. The light-control python program interprets those key presses and sends corresponding MQTT messages. The MQTT messages are received by Home Assistent, which then sends commands to the Wi-Fi bulbs.
